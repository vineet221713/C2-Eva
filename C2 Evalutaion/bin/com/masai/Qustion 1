Difference between IS-A and Has-A relationship..

Ans ...

IS-A Relation--> 
-------------
IT is totally based on inheretance .
which can be of two types Class Inheritance or Interface Inheritance
For example, Apple is a Fruit, Car is a Vehicle etc.
Inheritance is uni-directional
 For example, House is a Building. But Building is not a House.
 Here We Used key word..
 extends keyword or implements keyword in a class declaration,
 then this class is said to have IS-A relationship.
 
 
 Has A Relation --->
 --------------
 instance variables that are references to other objects
 Maruti has Engine, or House has Bathroom..
 
 ex...

class Car {
	
	private String color;
	private int maxSpeed; 
	public void carInfo(){
		System.out.println("Car Color= "+color + " Max Speed= " + maxSpeed);
	}
	public void setColor(String color) {
		this.color = color;
	}
	public void setMaxSpeed(int maxSpeed) {
		this.maxSpeed = maxSpeed;
	}
}

class Maruti extends Car{
	
	public void MarutiStartDemo(){
		Engine MarutiEngine = new Engine();
		MarutiEngine.start();
		}
	}



Access Modifiers 
-----------------
In Java, access modifiers are used to set the accessibility (visibility) of classes, interfaces, variables, methods, constructors, 
data members, and the setter methods.

The access modifiers in Java specifies the scope of a field, method,
constructor, or class. We can change the access level of fields, constructors, methods,
and class by applying the access modifier on it.

ex..
class Animal {
    public void method1() {...}

   private void method2() {...}
}
	
	
	
There are four types of Java access modifiers:
1. Private: 
The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. It cannot be
accessed from outside the class.
2. Default:
 The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. It cannot
be accessed from outside the package. Aka package-protected. If you do not
specify any access level, it will be the default.
3. Protected: 
The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and
outside the package through child class. If you do not make the child class, it cannot
be accessed from outside the package.
4. Public: 
The access level of a public modifier is everywhere. It can be accessed
from within the class, outside the class, within the package and outside the
package.
